# Demo 1: Finding and Fixing Basic Bugs üêõ

---

## Goal

Use print statements and error messages to find and fix simple bugs.

---

## Setup

- Provided script with common beginner bugs:
  - Typos
  - Wrong variable names
  - Off-by-one errors

---

## Tasks

1. **Run the script.** Observe the error message.
2. **Read the traceback.** Identify the line and error type.
3. **Add print statements** before the error to inspect variables.
4. **Fix the bug.** Rerun to confirm.
5. **Repeat** for other bugs in the script.

## Expected Outcomes

- Students can interpret error messages.
- Students can use print statements to trace program flow.
- Students fix syntax and logic errors confidently.

## Notes

<!--
Reading errors carefully and adding print statements are the first steps in debugging.
